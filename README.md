# Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree

This repository contains the work I did while taking Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree course in 2020. The main learning outcomes were:

* [Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL](./1a_data-modeling-postgres) - normalized vs denormalized data models; 1st, 2nd and 3rd normalized forms; star and snowflake schemas; ETL on Postgres;
* [NoSQL data modeling with Apache Cassandra](./1b_data-modeling-cassandra) - denormalized data models and NoSQL databases; modeling according to queries; pros and cons of Apache Cassandra against other SQL and NoSQL databases; ETL on Apache Cassandra;
* [Data Warehouse in AWS Redshift](./2_data-warehouse) - data warehouse models; usage of AWS Redshift; infrastructure as code applied to AWS Redshift clusters; ETL on AWS Redshift
* [Data lakes, Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark](./3_data-lake) - "schema on read" and data lakes; hadoop-based techonologies useful for building data lakes; AWS S3 and AWS EMR in the context of data lake; Apache Spark and ETL on data lakes;
* [Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow](./4_data-pipeline) - importance of managing complexity in complex data pipelines; "data pipeline as code" in Apache Airflow; managing ETL pipelines in Apache Airflow;
